# Development Checkpoint

## Current Status
- Enhanced JsonDisplayNode to properly handle string values
- Application is functional with basic node connections
- Added new CalculationNode with real-time calculation and improved UI
- Created a reusable BaseNode component as a foundation for new node types
- Added JoinNode for string concatenation with customizable separator
- Implemented CSVImportNode with drag-and-drop file import, preview, and collapsible UI

## Identified Issues
1. **Debug Display Node**: Currently only shows one input when multiple connections are made to it

## Next Steps
1. Enhance Debug Display Node to show multiple inputs
2. Continue testing with different node combinations
3. Test CalculationNode with various input types and edge cases
4. Test JoinNode with different input types and separators
5. Test CSVImportNode with various CSV file formats and sizes

## Checkpoint 5: Node Cleanup (Current)

### Completed Tasks
- Removed unused node components:
  - AnnotationNode
  - ResizerNode
  - CircleNode
  - TextInputNode
  - ToolbarNode
  - Default node
  - Input node
  - Output node
- Updated NodeSelector to remove references to deleted nodes
- Updated page.tsx to remove imports and nodeTypes references
- Cleaned up CSS styles related to deleted nodes
- Updated README.md to reflect current node components

### Current Node Components
- NumberInput: Allows numeric input with min/max constraints
- CostInput: Specialized input for cost values with currency
- Calculation: Performs mathematical operations on inputs
- JoinString: Concatenates text values with a customizable separator
- CSVImport: Imports and parses CSV files with preview
- JsonLoad: Loads and parses JSON data
- JsonDisplay: Displays and extracts values from JSON
- DebugDisplay: Shows internal data of connected nodes
- Result: Displays calculation results with formatting options
- BaseNode: Base node component for creating new nodes

### Next Steps
- Continue refining existing nodes
- Add more specialized nodes as needed
- Improve error handling and edge cases
- Enhance UI/UX for better user experience
