# Development Checkpoint

## Current Status
- Enhanced JsonDisplayNode to properly handle string values
- Application is functional with basic node connections
- Added new CalculationNode with real-time calculation and improved UI
- Created a reusable BaseNode component as a foundation for new node types
- Added JoinNode for string concatenation with customizable separator

## Identified Issues
1. **Debug Display Node**: Currently only shows one input when multiple connections are made to it

## Next Steps
1. Enhance Debug Display Node to show multiple inputs
2. Continue testing with different node combinations
3. Test CalculationNode with various input types and edge cases
4. Test JoinNode with different input types and separators
