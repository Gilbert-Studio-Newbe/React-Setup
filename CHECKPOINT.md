# Development Checkpoint

## Current Status
- Implemented CalculationNode with improved input handling
- Enhanced JsonDisplayNode to properly handle string values
- Application is functional with basic node connections

## Identified Issues
1. **Debug Display Node**: Currently only shows one input when multiple connections are made to it
2. **Calculation Node Output**: The node calculates results correctly but doesn't properly pass the result as its output value

## Next Steps
1. Enhance Debug Display Node to show multiple inputs
2. Fix Calculation Node to properly pass its result as the output value
3. Continue testing with different node combinations
