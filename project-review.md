  - Flow-specific pages are organized under `/src/app/flow`
  - Test flow is separated in `/src/app/flow/test`
  - ✅ **ENHANCED**: Created a simplified flow page at `/src/app/flow/simple-page.tsx` to demonstrate core functionality
- [x] Component organization
  - ✅ Components are now organized in subdirectories by type:
    - `/src/components/nodes` for node components
    - `/src/components/edges` for edge components

- [x] Circular dependencies
  - No obvious circular dependencies detected

### 1.5 Dependency Management
- [x] External dependencies
  - Core dependencies: Next.js 14.1.0, React 18.3.1, @xyflow/react 12.4.4
  - Additional libraries: papaparse for CSV parsing
  - TailwindCSS for styling
  - ✅ **RESOLVED**: Installed missing d3-zoom package required by @xyflow/react
  - ✅ **RESOLVED**: Installed @geist-ui/core package for UI components
